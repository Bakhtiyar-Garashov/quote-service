# quote-service

Quote service is a part of payment system which can be used to create quotes by users for money transactions

Altough this is my first Golang project after quite long time I have tried to structure the projects as 'clean' as I can.

Reference: <https://nurcahyaari.medium.com/how-i-implement-clean-code-architecture-on-golang-projects-68be58830621>

If you want to get the project up and running:

Requirements:

1) Golang installed and configured properly

2) PostgreSQL database server installed

Steps to follow:

1) Download project

2) Create Database with name of your choice

3) Create `.env` example in the projects root directory and add your database connection params into. Please refer to `.env.example` file for required params

4) Project entry point is main.go file. So, use `go run main.go` command
